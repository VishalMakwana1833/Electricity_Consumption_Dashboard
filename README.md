# Electricity_Consumption_Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing India's electricity consumption patterns using monthly data segmented by state, category, subcategory, and variable types. The dataset includes columns such as state, date, category, subcategory, unit, value, and year-on-year changes.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/VishalMakwana1833/Electricity_Consumption_Dashboard/blob/main/Electricity_consumption_data.csv">Electricity Consumption Data</a>

## Questions KPIs 
- Total Electricity Consumption
- Top 5 States by Consumption
- Consumption by Category/Subcategory
- Peak Consumption Month
- Total Electricity Consumption by State
- Dashborad Interaction <a href="https://github.com/VishalMakwana1833/Electricity_Consumption_Dashboard/blob/main/Electricity%20Consumption%20Dashboard.jpg">View Dashboard </a>

## Process
- Load our dataset (Electricity Consumption.csv) into Power BI.
- Analyze electricity consumption trends across states, categories, time.
- Remove nulls and unnecessary columns, and Rename columns for clarity.
- Create DAX to Measure Total Consumption, Average Monthly Consumption, and YoY % consumption.
- Design a interactive dashboard using visual like KPIs Card, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Donut Chart, and Map.

## Project Insights
- Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are among the highest electricity-consuming states due to dense population and industrial hubs.
- Variable-specific trends show that certain sectors like agriculture consume more power during monsoon months, indicating seasonal dependency.

## Conclusion
The Electricity Consumption Analysis provided a comprehensive view of power usage trends across Indian states and sectors. The insights revealed that industrialized and urban regions contribute the most to total consumption, with significant seasonal and regional variations. Year-over-year trends highlight growing demand in developing states, emphasizing the need for optimized energy planning and infrastructure investment.
